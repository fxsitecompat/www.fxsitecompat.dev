---
The support for the [`touchenter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/touchenter) and [`touchleave`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/touchleave) events has been removed due to the removal from the [`TouchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent) spec.
