      title: "Bug 843579 - Remove prefix from :any-link"
---
The [`:any-link`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:any-link) CSS4 pseudo-class is now available in Firefox without the vender prefix. The support for the prefixed `:-moz-any-link` pseudo-class will be removed in the near future.
