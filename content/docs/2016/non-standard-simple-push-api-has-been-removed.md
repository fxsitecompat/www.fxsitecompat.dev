The non-standard [Simple Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/B2G_OS/API/Simple_Push_API) used for Firefox OS has been removed in favour of the standardized [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API). Simple Push has never shipped with Firefox for desktop or Android.
