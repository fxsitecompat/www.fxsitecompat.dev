The non-standard [`let` blocks and `let` expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#Non-standard_let_extensions) are now considered deprecated. The support for those `let` extensions, currently warned in the [Web Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console), will be removed from Firefox in the near future.

**Update**: The `let` expression support has been [removed with Firefox 41](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2015/let-expression-support-has-been-dropped/).
