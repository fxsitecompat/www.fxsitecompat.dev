The properties of CSS [Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations), [Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions) and [Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transforms) were [unprefixed with Firefox 16](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2012/various-css-properties-have-been-unprefixed/). Those prefix support will be removed in the future.
