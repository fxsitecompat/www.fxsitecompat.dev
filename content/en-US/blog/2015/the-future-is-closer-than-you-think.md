20 years ago, Netscape invented JavaScript, cookies, plug-ins and SSL that soon became an integral part of the Web. They even created [JSSS](http://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822) for Netscape 4 (if it had been standardized, we didn't have to wait for 2 *decades*, not 2 *years*, before CSS offered `calc()`, media queries and variables.) Getting over a long, unfortunate plateau after the browser war, we are now seeing a truly rich user experience and interoperability on the ever-improving Web. And Netscape's innovation spirit is living on in Firefox's heart.

While a bunch of wonderful features are devised and implemented, some of the legacy, non-standard or insecure technologies must go. Our new [Future Planned Changes](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/versions/future/) section is intended to give you further insights into site compatibility.

At present, the deprecations of [plug-in](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2015/plug-in-support-will-be-dropped-by-the-end-of-2016-except-flash/) and [SHA-1](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2015/sha-1-certificate-support-will-be-disabled-as-early-as-july-2016/) support in 2016 are important for you. The [move to HTTPS](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2015/insecure-http-will-be-deprecated/) is also approaching faster, so you should act as soon as possible especially if you are in charge of a large commercial site. It's not a matter of "if" but "when".

The modern Web is changing at a furious speed that we have never seen before. Don't wait until your site is broken!
