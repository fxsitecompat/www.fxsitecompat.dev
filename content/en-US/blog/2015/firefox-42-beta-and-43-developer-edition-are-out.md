Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 41, 42 Beta and 43 Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/) this week. Check out the [site compatibility documents](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/) for each version, and let us know if you find any other changes or regressions. Since our new workflow using [GitHub](https://github.com/fxsitecompat/www.fxsitecompat.com) and [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) is working well, we also have already posted a couple of Firefox 44 Nightly compatibility documents so that you can get prepared for those changes earlier. Don't forget to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FxSiteCompat), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FxSiteCompat) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+FxSiteCompatibility), and subscribe to the [site feed](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/index.xml) for updates.
