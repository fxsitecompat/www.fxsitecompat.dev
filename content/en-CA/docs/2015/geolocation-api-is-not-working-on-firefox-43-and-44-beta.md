Currently the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation) is not working on Firefox 43 and 44 Beta due to Mozilla's new Google Location Service API key and its rate limit. Both Mozilla and Google are aware of the issue and it will be solved soon.

**Update**: Apparently the issue has been solved by Google.
