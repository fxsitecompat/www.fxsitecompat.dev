Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 52 Beta and 53 Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) last week. We're still reading through all the changes but our [site compatibility documents](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/) should already be covering the most:

* [Firefox 52 Site Compatibility](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/versions/52/)
* [Firefox 53 Site Compatibility](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/versions/53/)

As mentioned in the [previous post](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/blog/2016/firefox-51-beta-and-52-developer-edition-come-with-some-important-changes/), Firefox 52 will bring the following major changes you should be aware of:

* [The plug-in support will be removed other than Flash](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2016/plug-in-support-has-been-dropped-other-than-flash/). Java applets, Silverlight videos, and any other legacy plug-in content will no longer work. Take an immediate action if you're affected.
* [The touch event support will be enabled on Windows desktop](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2016/touch-event-support-has-been-re-enabled-on-windows-desktop/). Never rely on touch events to detect mobile, or your site will be unusable for those who are using a laptop or desktop computer with a touchscreen.

Last week, we have received a £30 [donation](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/contribute/#donate-to-us) from [Craig Francis](https://twitter.com/craigfrancis). Thank you, Craig!
